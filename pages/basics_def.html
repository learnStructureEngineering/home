                <h3>Strain</h3>
                <p>
                    When force is applied on a member, the size and shape of the member change. This change in dimension per unit initial dimension
                    is known as strain. This is sort of general definition of stain. If it was hard to grasp the idea, let's break this into various types.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Axial Strain</h3>
                <img src="../images/axial-strain.PNG" alt="Please refresh" style="float:right;" />
                <p>
                    When axial load is applied on a rod, the length of rod changes. This change in length of rod divided by original length
                    of the rod is known as axial strain. This is also known as normal strain or longitudinal strain. <br />
                    <span style="font-style:italic;"> Axial strain = (Final length - Initial length)/ Initial length =del l/l</span>

                </p>
                <p>
                    The axial strain can be tensile or compressive depending on the type of axial load applied. If the external force P tends to
                    increase length of the rod, then it is tensile strain and if P tends to reduce length of rod, then it is compressive strain.
                    In the figure above, it’s tensile strain.
                </p>

            <div>
                <h3>Shear Strain</h3>
                <img src="../images/shear-strain.PNG" alt="Please refresh" style="float:right;" />

                <p>
                    When an element is subjected to shear force as shown in figure aside, the angle between faces of element changes. This change in
                    angle in radian is known as shear strain. In the figure aside the initial angle between face AC and AB was < BAC. After the
                    application of load P, the body deforms such that angle between face AC and AB becomes < CAB'. So the change in angle is < BAB' which is denoted as γ in the figure and is also known as shear strain.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Volumetric Strain</h3>
                <img src="../images/vol-strain.PNG" alt="Please refresh" style="float:right;" />

                <p>
                    If a body is subjected to forces from all sides like in figure aside, then the volume of the 
                    body changes. The change in volume divided by original volume of the body is known as volumetric strain. This is also known as bulk strain.
