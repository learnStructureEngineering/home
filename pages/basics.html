                <h3>Forces and Stress</h3>
                <p>
                    When external load (force or moment) is applied on a deformable body, internal force develops within the body.
                    This internal force acting on unit area is known as stress. There are basically two types of stress:
                    normal stress (tensile stress and compressive stress) and shear stress.
                </p>

                <h3>Axial Force & Axial Stress</h3>

                <p>
                    Axial force is the internal force acting normal to the cross section of a member and axial stress
                    is axial force acting on unit cross sectional area.
                </p>
                <p>

                    To visualize axial force, imagine a solid circular bar of radius r fixed at one end and subjected to load P at free end.
                    Due to load P, all the cross sections of rod will be subjected to stress normal (or perpendicular) to its plane as shown if figure.
                    As we know force= stress x area, if we multiply these stresses with corresponding areas, then we obtain the forces acting on that areas.
                    By adding up all these forces we get what is called axial force.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Axial force if it tends to increase the length of member then it is called tensile force and corresponding stress is called tensile stress.
                     <br />
                    Similarly if axial force tends to reduce the length of member then it is called compressive force and corresponding stress is called compressive stress.

                </p>

            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Shear Force & Shear Stress</h3>
                <img src="../images/shear-stress.PNG" alt="Please refresh" style="float:right;" />
                <p>
                    Shear force is the internal force acting parallel to the cross section of a member. And shear stress is
                    shear force acting on unit area.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    To visualize shear force, imagine two planks as shown in figure aside. The bottom plank is clamped to the ground and top plank is attached on top of
                    bottom plank with the help of glue. Now the top plank is subjected to load P. As a result shear stress τ is developed on
                    interface. When the shear stress τ exceeds strength of glue, then the planks get separated.
                </p>

                <h3>Bending Moment & Bending Stress</h3>
                <p>Bending moment at any section of a member is algebraic
                sum of moments developed due to external loads and reactions to the left or right of the section only. </p>
                <p>Bending moment at any section occurs whenever there is both compressive and tensile force on that section. If there is purely
                compressive stress on the section, the section will be in compression only and if there is purely tensile 
                stress on the section, then the section will be in tension only.</p>
                <img src="../images/bending.PNG" alt="Please refresh" style="float:right;" />
                <p>
                    When a transverse force acts on any member (let's say beam), the beam will bend in the plane of load as shown in figure aside.
                    Now let's observe carefully, the upper fibers will be shortened and so will be in compression, whereas lower fibers will be elongated and so will be in tension.
                    This type of stress is called bending stress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In between those planes, there is one plane which has same length before and after the application of load. This plane is called neutral plane.
                    The intersection of neutral plane with the cross section of beam gives neutral axis.<br />
                    The summation of forces above the neutral axis gives compression and below the neutral axis gives tension. The couple formed by equal and opposite
                    tension and compression is called <b> bending moment</b>.
